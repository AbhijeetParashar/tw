# Requirements

You need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). And that's it.

I'm using Babel to run ES2015. So don't worry, you won't have to read ES5 code.


# Instructions tu Run This

- `npm install` to create a folder full of the most outlandish dependencies.
- `npm start [filename]` to start. If something explodes, don't worry. It's part of the masterplan.
- `npm lint` to lint my code in case you think it's not pretty enough.
